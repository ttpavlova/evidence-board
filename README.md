Evidence board is a project for creating schemes with connections between elements.

# Demo

You can try the demo at https://evidence-board.netlify.app/

# Overview

There are three types of items: elements, connections and notes. Any element can be connected to another element, elements can have multiple connections.

Elements contain an image and a title and represent an object of investigation. A connection is a line that tells how exactly two elements are connected to each other, what they have in common. And notes have additional information that is explained more detailed.

The board is interactive. You can move elements and notes to any place of the working area. The connections will follow the movable element.
